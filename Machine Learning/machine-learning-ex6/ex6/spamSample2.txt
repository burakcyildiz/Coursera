Hi Burak,

As discussed, please come in at 12:00pm on Wednesday, March 21. In addition to your interview with Masha and the technical assessment tests, you will also be meeting with John Yawney, our Data Science Practice Lead. 

Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions during the interim.

Thanks,
Winnie
